  <p class="mb-4"><strong>Overview:</strong> Engaged with a mid-sized finance team struggling with Excel-bound forecasting. Built an LLM-based tool that ingested structured and unstructured data, then generated dynamic variance narratives and “what-if” scenarios using GPT.</p>
  <p class="mb-4"><strong>Challenge:</strong> Time-consuming manual analysis, poor communication between departments, and lack of clarity in forecasts.</p>
  <p class="mb-4"><strong>Approach:</strong> Designed and implemented a GPT-powered FP&A chatbot, used LangChain + FAISS to allow natural-language queries over documentation, connected to live financial data pipelines.</p>
  <p class="mb-4"><strong>Result:</strong> 45% decrease in time-to-decision, leadership could explore forecasts without technical gatekeeping, boosted stakeholder trust in finance team’s insight generation.</p>
  <p class="mb-4"><strong>What We Learned:</strong> Data doesn’t just need to be available—it needs to be interpretable at the speed of thought.</p>
