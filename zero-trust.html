No device is trusted. No action is unverified. Welcome to the principle of Zero Trust — where we assume breach and verify every step.</p>\n </header>\n\n <main class="max-w-5xl mx-auto px-6 py-12 space-y-10">\n <section class="bg-gray-800 p-6 rounded-lg shadow-md">\n <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-red-300 mb-4">What Is Zero Trust?</h2>\n <p class="text-gray-300">Zero Trust is a cybersecurity framework centered around the idea that threats exist both inside and outside the network. Rather than automatically trusting anything inside the network, Zero Trust requires verification for every user, device, and data flow. It's a shift from static defenses to dynamic, identity-aware access control.</p>\n </section>\n\n <section class="bg-gray-800 p-6 rounded-lg shadow-md">\n <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-red-300 mb-4">Core Pillars of Zero Trust</h2>\n <ul class="list-decimal list-inside text-gray-300 space-y-2">\n <li>Continuous Verification of Identity, Device, and Context</li>\n <li>Least Privilege Access Across the Board</li>\n <li>Microsegmentation of Workloads and Services</li>\n <li>Encryption of Data in Transit and at Rest</li>\n <li>Real-Time Threat Detection and Adaptive Access Controls</li>\n </ul>\n </section>\n\n <section class="bg-gray-800 p-6 rounded-lg shadow-md">\n <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-red-300 mb-4">Strategic Benefits</h2>\n <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">Implementing Zero Trust protects your organization from insider threats, lateral movement by attackers, and gaps in legacy access policies. It increases resilience across cloud services, hybrid environments, and remote workforces.</p>\n <p class="text-gray-300">Firms that embrace Zero Trust can expect:</p>\n <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-300 mt-2 space-y-2">\n <li>Reduced attack surfaces</li>\n <li>Enhanced incident containment</li>\n <li>Faster regulatory compliance responses</li>\n <li>Stronger endpoint protections</li>\n </ul>\n </section>\n\n <section class="bg-gray-800 p-6 rounded-lg shadow-md">\n <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-red-300 mb-4">Practical Implementation Tips</h2>\n <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">Getting started with Zero Trust doesn't require a complete overhaul.
