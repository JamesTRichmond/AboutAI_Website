  <p class="mb-4"><strong>Overview:</strong> Partnered with a K–12 district to redesign their aging IT infrastructure. The objective was to align their network with NIST 800-53 standards and implement a Zero Trust security model that protected student data, controlled internal access, and strengthened incident readiness.</p>
  <p class="mb-4"><strong>Challenge:</strong> Outdated architecture with shared access, no RBAC, and insufficient visibility into network events.</p>
  <p class="mb-4"><strong>Approach:</strong> Designed NIST-compliant access control policies (RBAC, MFA, logging), deployed SIEM integration and encryption at rest & in transit, implemented device posture enforcement and segmented networks.</p>
  <p class="mb-4"><strong>Result:</strong> Reduced lateral movement risks by 95%, increased audit readiness, gave IT admins real-time visibility into threats & misconfigurations.</p>
  <p class="mb-4"><strong>What We Learned:</strong> Educators need simplicity. We created admin dashboards using visual metaphors familiar to non-technical staff.</p>
